## What will happen next?

1. Issues with access are given the highest priority and where possible I will bump feature and other bugs to focus on these tasks. 
2. After receiving the report, I will schedule it into [my roadmap](https://github.com/users/miclgael/projects/4) (currently private).
3. As soon as I have scheduled the issue into my roadmap, I will comment on the issue with a planned work-start date. 
4. Please note, due to my deployment strategy, the issue may be closed before a change is visible on the live website. In these cases, I will endeavour to add the fix version as another comment. 
5. You can always find the current version of the app in the footer of the website. ![Screen Shot of current version in footer](https://github.com/miclgael/issues/assets/4301358/0af5b8bf-c09e-4a44-9652-924c32a7ab24)
